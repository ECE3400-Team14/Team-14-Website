# Lab 4: FPGA and Camera

## Team Arduino
### Configuring the Camera
2 points: Arduino-Camera communication (writing the correct registers)

### Setting up Arduino-FPGA Communication
3 points: Arduino-FPGA communication (communicating treasure/no treasure + shape and color)

## Team FPGA

### Setting Up PLL

### Down-sampler and Color Detection

### Camera Simulation
2 points: Displaying the contents of an M9K block on the screen

## Integrating the Camera, Arduino, and FPGA
3 points: Camera-FPGA communication (downsampling and storing in the M9K buffer)
2 points: Displaying the test image from the camera on the screen
3 points: Color detection with the FPGA, camera, and Arduino
