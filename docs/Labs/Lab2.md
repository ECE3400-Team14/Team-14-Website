#  Lab 2: Analog Circuitry and FFT’s

**Purpose:** The goal of this lab was to test and implement the audio and IR signal detection systems to be added onto our robot at a later date. This involved preparing both the analog and digital components necessary for our robot to perform signal analysis. Our first task was to capture an audio signal via an amplified microphone circuit and detect a 660 Hz signal. Our second task was to read a 6.08 kHz IR signal using a phototransistor circuit while ignoring an 18 kHz IR signal. Analysis of these signals were done on an Arduino using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis through the [Open Music Labs FFT Library](http://wiki.openmusiclabs.com/wiki/ArduinoFFT). 

**Team Assignment:** David and Greg worked on the audio-detection task while Andrew and Michael worked on IR detection. Both groups worked on constructing the combined audio-IR analysis system.

## Audio Team:

2 points: Correct FFT analysis for audio

2 points: Working amplifier (or active filter) circuit for audio

2 points: Distinguish a 660Hz tone from background noise (talking/music)

## IR Team:

For our IR circuit, we started with the circuit that only consists of the phototransistor and a 1.8kΩ resistor, as provided in the lab handout:

And it looks like this on the breadboard:

We started testing this circuit to determine if we actually need an amplifier or an active filter. First, we connect the oscilloscope to see if the circuit works, and it worked like a charm. Here's the waveform detected by the oscilloscope from the IR hat that emits a 6.08kHz IR signal. As we can see, the frequency we pick up is not a perfect 6.08kHz. Instead, it is about 6.47kHz.

After seeing the result, we were satisfied with the strength of the signal as this circuit actually acts as an amplifier. The current generated by the light affects the base region and this is amplified by the current gain of the transistor in the normal way. We also decided that the filtering can be done digitally as it would be more effective and clean.

By modifying the sample code given by the FFT library and plotting the output, we can clearly distinguish the robot signal and the decoy signal. But first, we had to make a minor and yet important change to our code. In the sample code, ADCSRA was set up to be 0xe5, where the last last digit corresponds to the prescale factor as shown in the table below.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42748229/46558523-60024080-c8bb-11e8-8624-8f1513b950d4.png"/>

The theoretical sampling frequency is calculated as follows. The arduino ADC clock runs at 16MHz. If the prescale factor is 64, i.e. ADCSRA set to 0xe6, the clock then runs at 16/64 = 0.25MHz. Each ADC conversion takes 13 cycles, which means the theoretical sampling frequency is 0.25MHz/13 = 19.2kHz. In order to eliminate aliasing for our 18kHz signal, the sampling rate needs to be at least 36kHz, which means a prescale factor of 32 should suffice. However, since the calculation is theoretical, we set the prescale factor to 16 just to be safe. This way, we absolutely would not confuse the 18kHz signal with the 6kHz signal. With a sampling frequency of 76.8kHz and 128 bins, the 6kHz signal, which is actually 6.47kHz, should have a peak at bin 21, as 6.47kHz is between 76.8/2/128\*21 = 6.3kHz and 76.8/2/128\*22 = 6.6kHz. Similarly, the 18kHz decoy signal should have a peak near bin 62. As we plot the arrays obtained through FFT, we see exactly that.

*FFT from IR Hat*

*FFT from Decoy*

By setting an appropriate threshold for bin 21, we can detect the IR hat from about 50cm away and ignore the decoy. We connected an external LED to indicate such detection.

```cpp
if (fft_log_out[21] > 60) digitalWrite(LED_pin, HIGH);
else digitalWrite(LED_pin, LOW);
```

## Integrated System:

To have an integrated system, we added an extra mux in order to conserve analog input ports. The mux is an analog 8-to-1 mux with 3-bit selection inputs. Pin diagram and function table shown below.

Since we only have two signals going into the mux, we decided to ground S1 and S2, and only control S0 so that we select from A1 and A0. Pin 6, which is enable, also needs to be grounded, since it's active-low.

[integrated system circuit diagram?]

When our system first starts running, it only receives signal from the microphone and waits for the 660Hz signal. Once it detects a tone at that frequency, it flips S0 so now it only receives signal from the phototransistor. From that point on, it ignores the decoy signal at about 18kHz and reacts once it detects the IR hat signal from other robots at about 6kHz.
