## Robot changes as of 9/14/18 (Milestone 1 complete)
We made just a few modifications to improve our robot going forward in prototyping: 
 - Attached larger wheels to the robot to increase our speed.
 - Added rubber bands ont he wheels for grip.
 - Raised the Arduino above the chassis in order to have more secure placement for the breadboard,
and cleaner, easier access to the electrical connections. 
 - Upgraded the line sensors to 3-wire ribbon cables to keep connections compact.
 - Moved the ball bearing leg down in order to keep the robot stable.
