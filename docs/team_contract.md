##Team Expectations:

_Work Quality:_

Project standards (What is a realistic level of quality for team presentations, collaborative writing, individual research, preparation of drafts, peer reviews, etc.?):

Written drafts should be reviewed by all members. Reviewers can correct typos/grammar but should leave comments for more robust changes. [Allow re-writing if necessary?]

Strategies to fulfill these standards: Collaborative google doc for assignments. Note: make sure this google doc is done before deadline so document can be transferred to markdown/html

_Team Participation:_

1. Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks: 

[Tasks should be distributed initially at meetings. Labs will act as check-ins on these tasks where we can colaborate/help each other complete certain tasks]

2. Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance):

[Discuss before acting? --> make sure there is a clear plan before going forward with idea, then let everyone way in]

3. Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):
[Lab group checkins, progress reports in communication group (weekly or biweekly?) ]

4. Preferences for leadership (informal, formal, individual, shared): [I would prefer informal]

_Personal Accountability:_

1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings: 

[My idea: Try to arrive at meeting 5 min early]

2. Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:

[Once we set timeline, should try to stick to it pretty consistently. Timelines should allow time for trial/error & team colaboration]

3. Expected level of communication with other team members: 

[Any planned meeting/lab work time conflicts should be made known as soon as possible. Should not be last minute if possible]

4. Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks:

[I will commit to all timelines & meetings]
