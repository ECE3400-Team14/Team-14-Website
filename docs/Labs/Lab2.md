#  Lab 2: Analog Circuitry and FFTâ€™s

**Purpose:

**Team Assignment: David and Greg worked on audio while Andrew and Michael worked on IR.

## Audio Team:

2 points: Correct FFT analysis for audio
2 points: Working amplifier (or active filter) circuit for audio
2 points: Distinguish a 660Hz tone from background noise (talking/music)

## IR Team:

2 points: Correct FFT analysis for IR
2 points: Working amplifier (or active filter) circuit for IR
2 points: Distinguish a 6.08kHz IR signal from an IR signal at 18kHz

## Integrated System:

3 points: Demonstration of a single system with nicely merged code that can do both IR and audio
