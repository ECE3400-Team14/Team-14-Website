# Elevation's Robot

Tall Boi is outfitted with almost entirely default materials provided by ECE 3400, and is very capable with just those pieces!

## Capabilities

Tall Boi can track lines and intersections with great accuracy (if batteries are propery fueled), sense walls on three sides
for maze mapping, detect a 660Hz audio start signal, detect other robots' IR signals, and detect treasure color and location.
In terms of software, [Dijkstra's algorithm probably best explained by David but I'll re read Milestone 3 for a refresher],
and adapts to detected robot's in its vicinity.
