#  Lab 2: Analog Circuitry and FFT’s

**Purpose:**

**Team Assignment:** David and Greg worked on audio while Andrew and Michael worked on IR.

## Audio Team:

2 points: Correct FFT analysis for audio

2 points: Working amplifier (or active filter) circuit for audio

2 points: Distinguish a 660Hz tone from background noise (talking/music)

## IR Team:

For our IR circuit, we started with the circuit that only consists of a phototransistor and a 1.8kΩ resistor, as provided in the lab handout:

And it looks like this:

2 points: Correct FFT analysis for IR

2 points: Working amplifier (or active filter) circuit for IR

2 points: Distinguish a 6.08kHz IR signal from an IR signal at 18kHz

## Integrated System:

3 points: Demonstration of a single system with nicely merged code that can do both IR and audio
