# Milestone 4: Treasure Detection

### Purpose: The goal of this milestone was to implement treasure detection onto our robot. This required our robot to use the [OV7670 Camera](http://web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2016/tools/OV7670_2006.pdf) to detect red or blue triangles, squares, and diamonds on the walls of the maze.
