# Team Contract
ECE 3400, Fa 2018 Team # 14

Team Members: David Burgstahler (dfb93), Gregory Kaiser (ghk48), Andrew Lin (yl656), Michaelangelo Rodriguez Ayala (mr2242)

## Team Procedures: 

1. Day, time, and place for regular team meetings:

    * UH142, Friday 11:15-12:05pm, weekly.
    * Duffield/Upson, Monday 5:00pm-6:00pm, as necessary (we will determine if we need this meeting during the previous week, either at a team meeting or via group message).

2. Preferred method of communication (e.g., e-mail, cell phone, wired phone, Blackboard Discussion Board, face-to-face, in a certain class) in order to inform each other of team meetings, announcement, updates, reminders, problems:

    * We will use a facebook group for coordinating team meetings and progress on project tasks. 
    * Email can be used for reporting to the group on large project milestones, such as project reports. 
    * Github use protocol: In order to streamline code development, members of the group should notify other members via the Facebook group of any finished code pushed to the project. Members should also message the group to handle any code merging conflicts. 
    * Any non-code resources (i.e. images, videos, diagrams) should be uploaded to the shared folder on Google Drive, where such resources can be reviewed before posting to the website.  

3. Decision-making policy:

    We will come to team decisions by majority rule, meaning that a proposed agenda idea approved by at least 3 members will be treated as group consensus. 

4. Method for setting and following meeting agendas (Who will set each agenda? When? How will team members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting? What will be done to keep the team on track during a meeting?):

    We will have a shared google document to list and manage our meeting agenda. Any member can add agenda items before the meeting. The team leader will manage this document. 

5. Method of record keeping (Who will be responsible for recording & disseminating minutes? How & when will the minutes be disseminated? Where will all agendas & minutes be kept?):

    Meeting minutes will be recorded in the agenda document. All team members are responsible for notating any meeting results in the shared google doc under the relevant agenda item. 

## Team Expectations:

_Work Quality:_

Project standards (What is a realistic level of quality for team presentations, collaborative writing, individual research, preparation of drafts, peer reviews, etc.?):

* Written drafts should be reviewed by all members. Reviewers can correct typos/grammar but should leave comments for more robust changes. 
* Strategies to fulfill these standards: We will compile initial drafts of all written assignments in collaborative google documents. For final drafts, we will set a team deadline for these drafts before the due date (by at least 5 to 6 hours) so we have time to transfer all writing from the google doc to the website. 

_Team Participation:_

1. Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks: 

    Tasks should be distributed initially at meetings. Labs will act as check-ins on these tasks where we can collaborate/help each other complete certain tasks. Expected in-lab tasks will be designated beforehand during meetings.

2. Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance):

    Any new ideas or changes to the project plan should be proposed at team meetings. Members can then weigh in on these ideas, suggest modifications, and vote on the final plan. At meetings, we will make sure there is a clear plan with tasks for all team members before going forward with independent work or lab/team work. 

3. Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):

    During labs, we will check in with each other’s progress. Labs will be the time to make any small changes to the agreed-upon agenda and providing team assistance on any critical tasks. In addition, if a team member is struggling he should message the rest of the team asking for help/guidance/re-assignment.

4. Preferences for leadership (informal, formal, individual, shared): 

    Leaders for general areas of work will have to emerge organically since we are unaware of skills in which we perform best. If someone is responsible for a task, they are de facto leader of that task so changes to a mechanism or code related to that task must be run by that person.

_Personal Accountability:_

1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings: 

    Team members will commit to arriving at planned team meetings 5 minutes early. A person who arrives up to 10 minutes late with a lame excuse more than once will get a stern talking to.

2. Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:

    Once we set timeline, team members are responsible for delivering by this timeline consistently. Timelines should allow time for trial/error & team collaboration. Each individual is expected to communicate clearly about progress on a task, and about whether or not it will be completed on time.

3. Expected level of communication with other team members: 

    ny planned meeting/lab work time conflicts should be made known as soon as possible, with at least 24 hours of notice to all team members via group chat or email. 

4. Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks:

    Team members will commit to any plans agreed upon by group consensus, including attendance of team meetings and deadlines for project tasks. Any disagreements with such decisions must be brought up during team meetings. 


_Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations_

1. Describe, as a group, you would handle infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract:

    Team meeting will commence with all members present at the indicated start time, and late members will forfeit their ability to dispute any consensus made in their unexcused absence. On the homepage of our website, we will have a scoreboard to keep track of the number of late arrivals to meeting and/or late deadline deliveries. 

2. Describe what your team will do if the infractions continue:

    A dunce cap (or another piece of identifiable clothing, yet to be constructed) will be worn by those who commit multiple offenses against this contract. It shall be worn during team meetings for a duration chosen by the rest of the team, based on the number of infractions. The “dunce” shall be responsible for the article of shaming clothing, and it shall be returned to the team bin when time has been served.
