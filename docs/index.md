Welcome to our website for [ECE 3400: Intelligent Physical Systems](https://cei-lab.github.io/ece3400-2018/), a class required in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department at Cornell University. The course website describes ECE 3400 as: "a class where students learn to tie the fundamental principles of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) across virtual and physical boundaries to create autonomous robots able to perceive, reason about, and act upon their environment." Feel free to read more at the link above.

On this website we have logged our progress in creating such an autonomous robot. Team 14 has proven themselves as capable engineers with a strong ability to push through difficult times, where debugging and troubleshooting are our most valuable qualities. Below, each lab completed and milestone reached are carefully logged with visual aids and short video clips.

## Labs
* [Lab1](Labs/Lab1.md)
The goal of this lab was to become familiar with the Arduino Uno platform and the Arduino IDE.
* [Lab2](Labs/Lab2.md)
The goal of this lab was to test and implement the audio and IR signal detection systems to be added onto our robot at a later date. We captured an audio signal via an amplified microphone circuit to detect a 660 Hz signal and read a 6.08 kHz IR signal using a phototransistor circuit.
* [Lab3](Labs/Lab3.md)
The goal of this lab was to integrate the components from previous labs and milestones into our robot and use radio communication between Arduinos to update the provided Graphical User Inteface (GUI) with accurate maze data from the robot. 
* [Lab4](Labs/Lab4.md)
The goal of this lab was to set up the Camera-FPGA system our robot will use to detect treasures during the competition.

## Milestones
* [Milestone1](Milestones/Milestone1.md)
Line sensing, intersection detection, and controlled turning.
* [Milestone2](Milestones/Milestone2.md)
Wall sensing, and right-hand-wall-following algorithm.
* [Milestone3](Milestones/Milestone3.md)
Maze search algorithms.
* [Milestone4](Milestones/Milestone4.md)
Treasure detection.

## Other Robot Updates
* [New Wheels](OtherUpdates/newWheels.md)
Exactly what it sounds like.
* [Simulator](OtherUpdates/Simulator.md)
Some troubleshooting tools for teams next year to debug their camera input.
