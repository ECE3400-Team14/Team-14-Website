# Final Competition:

Much to our dismay, the treasures in the competition mazes were almost all in dead ends, spots where our robot was incapable of detecting them. In the end, we had to rely our our robot's movement, maze searching, and robot avoidance for points. 

## Round 1:
The first round was probably our least accurate maze mapping. The robot missed a turn early on, causing its coordinate system to become offset. We let it map out the maze of a minute of two after in case some of the data ligned up. Unforunately, we do no have video of our first round.

## Round 2:
Between rounds, we swapped out our bearing stand on the back of the robot with the hope that it would get less stuck, although this ended up causing the robot to shake more violently on rough surfaces. After a rough start, the robot was able to go through a decent amount of the maze. At [1:38](https://youtu.be/5bCzWhZV19c?t=97) in the video, we avoided a crash with another robot, which helped us avoid penalties. We also detected one accurate treasure but got two false positives, a net point gain of 0.

## Final Round:
Our performace in the first two rounds put our robot in the top four, bringing us into the final competition. Encountering more robots in this round, we ended up getting into a few crashes, but we recovered from them pretty well. We brough back our old bearing stand from the first round, although the robot continued to face a lot of mobility issues during this round. We had to reset it a lot of times, limiting the amount of maze we were able to map. But the parts that we did get were mostly accurate.

## The Tie-breaker:
Since our robot tied for thrid place in the final round, our robot had to run against one other robot in the same maze as the final round in a tie-breaker. This was our robot's best performance up to this point, mapping out and sending approximately 50% of the maze accurately, and [narrowly avoiding a collision](https://youtu.be/J4_RvZP1eGw?t=40). After about 3 minutes, our robot got stuck in a corner, so we picked it up. Since the other robot was facing hardware problems, and since it would take too long for our robot to discover new territory on a new run, we decided to stop running our robot after this point. After winning this round, our team received 3rd place in the competition.
